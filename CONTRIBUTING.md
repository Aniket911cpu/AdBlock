# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to this project! The following guidelines will help your contributions get merged quickly.

1. Reporting issues
   - Open an issue with a clear title and reproducible steps.
   - Include browser/version, extension version, and console errors if applicable.

2. Development workflow
   - Fork the repository and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
   - Make changes locally and test by loading the unpacked extension in a Chromium-based browser.
   - Keep commits focused and atomic; write descriptive commit messages.

3. Pull requests
   - Target the `main` branch (or the project's default branch).
   - Provide a clear description of what the PR changes and why, with screenshots if relevant.
   - Link related issues in the PR description.

4. Code style
   - Follow existing code style in JS/HTML/CSS files.
   - Avoid large unrelated refactors in the same PR.

5. Tests and verification
   - Manual testing is sufficient: reload the unpacked extension, exercise the popup/options UI, and verify blocking behavior.

6. License
   - By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's license (see `LICENSE`).

If you'd like a suggested template for PRs or issue templates, I can add them.
